# Tenzies Game

> Always wanted to try [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) . So used it in this.

This basic game was built while following the Scrimba React Course.

I am planning to add more features to this game on my own.

## Proposed features

- [ ] Add best moves score and store it in local storage

- [ ] Add timer

## Setting project locally

1. Fork repo and clone it using following command

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your username>/Tenzies.git
   ```

   replace `<your username>` with your github username

2. Change the directory

   ```bash
   cd Tenzies
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start development server

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> Then the development server will be started at [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/)
